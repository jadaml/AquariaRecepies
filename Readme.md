# Aquaria Cook book

Ever wanted a to have a tool for storing and reading recipes for the game Aquaria? 😁 No? 🙁 Well, you can now have it anyway! 😓

With this tool, you have the opportunity to record all the recipes that can be found in Aquaria, then browse them through, and read it from base ingredients up to the recipe of whatever you like. If however you do not wish to record all the different recipes, you can import others, if they share it with you.

[Aquaria][Aquaria] is a game set in an underwater world, where one of the game mechanism is that you can combine 2 or 3 ingredients in to each other, to get a new food, which provides you improved (or degraded) buffs during your game play. If you are not yet familiar with the game, I recommend you try the game first; [perhaps read about it first, or try the game.][Aquaria]
